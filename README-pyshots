gtkShots (and pyshots)
an utility to capture screenshots continuously
==============================================

gtkShots is a python/GTK application to capture screenshots continuosly.
It is a hand tool to automatically save the screenshots in a (un)specified 
period of time, with the possibility to schedule it and to choose options 
for each screenshot to be saved, such as the size, the parent folder and 
the time interval between them.

gtkShots could be used for a lot of different aims, for instance to create 
presentations, to monitor desktop activity, or for any other scope that 
needs a screenshots sequence.

gtkShots is actually a GUI frontend to pyshots, my command-line python 
script to do the same job. Thus, if you need to work on the terminal 
sessions, you could take advantage of this.

gtkShots / pyshots are completely FOSS, free and open source software, 
released under the terms of GNU GPL 2 license or (at your option) any 
later version. Please make a donation if you like gtkShots!
